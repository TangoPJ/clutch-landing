      <h3>LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA COLLECTION</h3>
      <ol style="list-style: none;">
        <li>
          <h4>2.1 Types of data / Privacy policy scope</h4>
          <p>
            "<strong>Personal Data</strong>" means any information about an
            individual from which that person can be identified. It does not
            include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
          </p>
          <p>
            We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal
            Data about you which we have grouped together below. Not all of the
            following types of data will necessarily be collected from you but
            this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect
            it from you:
          </p>
          <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li>
              Contact Data: This is data relating to your phone number,
              addresses, email addresses, phone numbers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you
            (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
            philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, 2 political
            opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and
            genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about
            criminal convictions and offences.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2.2 The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data</h4>
          <p>
            There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow
            collection and processing of Personal Data. The main avenues we rely
            on are:

          <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li>
              <p>
                "<strong>Consent</strong>": Certain situations allow us to
                collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a box that
                confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or
                ‘opt in’ to a service.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                "<strong>Legal Compliance</strong>": We’re required by law to
                collect and process certain types of Legal Compliance data, such
                as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                "<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>": We might need to collect
                certain information from you to be Legitimate Interest able to
                meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be
                reasonably expected as part of running our business, that will
                not have a material impact on your rights, freedom or interests.
                Examples could be your address, so that we know where to deliver

                informed about our purposes for processing your personal data,
                how long we store it for, and who it will be shared with. We

            <li>

                <strong>Right of access</strong>. This enables you to receive a
                copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we
                are lawfully processing it (also known as a "data subject access

                data. Note that this is not an absolute right and it only

          <h4>4.3 How Yamamoto Ltd protects customers' Personal Data</h4>
          <p>
            We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it
            from inappropriate disclosure. We implement a variety of security
            measures to ensure the security of your Personal Data on our
            systems, including Our company is hosted on the Wix.com platform.
            Wix.com provides us with the online platform that allows us to
            advertise our products and services to you. Your data may be stored
            through Wix.com’s data storage, databases and the general Wix.com
            applications. They store your data on secure servers behind a
            firewall. . Any Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by
            a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such
            systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when
            we use subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish
            control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that
            would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession.
            However, unfortunately no transmission of data over the internet is
            guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third
            parties not under the control of Yamamoto Ltd to intercept or access
            transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive
            to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the
            security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such
            transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your
            interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us.

          <h4>4.4 Opting out of marketing promotions</h4>
          <p>

            contacting us at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will
            continue to retain other Personal Data provided to us as a result of
            interactions with us not related to your marketing preferences.

            exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is
            clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your request.
          </p>

            We may need to request specific information from you to help us
            confirm your identity and ensure you have the right to access your
            Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
            security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to

            to ask you for further information in relation to your request to
            speed up our response.

        This version is dated 18 October 2024.

      <p>
        By using Yamamoto Ltd, you consent to the collection and use of data by

      <h3>INTERPRETATION</h3>
      <p>
        All uses of the word "including" mean "including but not limited to" and
        the enumerated examples are not intended to in any way limit the term
        which they serve to illustrate. Any email addresses set out in this
        policy may be used solely for the purpose for which they are stated to
        be provided, and any unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless
        otherwise required by law, we reserve the right to not respond to
        emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject matter for which we
        have provided an email address. You are more likely to get a reply if
        your request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no
        relatively obvious other way to deal with or answer your concern or
        question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of Yamamoto Ltd,
        waive rights or make representations (whether contractual or otherwise).
        If anything contained in an email from a Yamamoto Ltd address
        contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any official public
        announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a
        waiver of any Yamamoto Ltd rights, the email content will be read down
        to grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine
        correspondence expressed to be from the Yamamoto Ltd legal department.
