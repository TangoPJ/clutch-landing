            Personal Data. We are not obliged by the GDPR to appoint a data
            protection officer and have not voluntarily appointed one at this
            time. Therefore, any inquiries about your data should either be sent
            to us by email to julian.hill@clutchapp.co.uk or by post to 20
            Wenlock Road, London, N1 7GU, United Kingdom.

          <p>
            You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the
            Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory
            authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would,
            however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you
            approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
